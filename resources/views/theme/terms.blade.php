<h3 class="terms-heading">Same-Day Delivery - Monday to Friday</h3>
<p class="new-para-terms">
  Orders must be received before 2:00 p.m. in the recipient's time zone to assure same-day delivery. Orders received after that time will be delivered the following day. Flower deliveries to residential addresses usually occur between 9:00am and 7:00pm, and flower deliveries to work addresses usually occur between 9:00am and 5:00pm. Please note that these delivery times will likely be extended during busy floral events including (but not limited to) Mother's Day, Valentine's Day and Christmas.
</p>
<p class="new-para-terms">
    There are some locations due to their remoteness that cannot be guaranteed for same day delivery. If this is the case Petals will contact you to discuss alternate delivery options. Some deliveries may also be required to be collected from the nearest town or depot. Should this be the case our florist may contact the recipient to arrange. If you don’t want the recipient to be called please nominate yourself as the primary contact.
</p>
<p class="new-para-terms">
    Whilst Petals Network offers customers the opportunity to nominate a preferred time of delivery (i.e. AM, PM or ASAP) it is not possible to guarantee that these times will be achieved. Petals Network uses a network of local florists around Australia to deliver flowers so customers receive the freshest flowers available. Consequently, there are often local reasons why an order cannot be delivered within your preferred time frame (for example, courier delivery times).
</p>
<p class="new-para-terms">
    If the flowers are for a timed event (for example, a funeral or business function), the florists will do their best to assist. However, Petals Network strongly recommends that you provide us with an alternative address so the flowers can be delivered elsewhere if too late for the timed event.
</p>

<h3 class="terms-heading">Same-Day Delivery - Saturday</h3>

    <b>Sunday Delivery:</b>
    Delivery is not guaranteed for Sunday and generally not available. If Sunday delivery is preferred, it is advised that you make prior arrangements for this delivery with Petals Network.
</p>
<p class="new-para-terms">
    <b>Public Holiday Delivery:</b>
    As most couriers do not work on public holiday's delivery of flowers is generally not available on public holidays. Orders received on public holidays will be delivered on the next working day without notice to the customer.

<h3 class="terms-heading">Delivery Confirmation</h3>
<p class="new-para-terms">
    If you haven’t received an order confirmation and are simply wanting to know that your order has been received by Petals, please contact our friendly Customer Service Team on 1800 888 668. We can easily email you confirmation of the order if there has been a system glitch preventing us from sending confirmation first time around.
</p>
<p class="new-para-terms">
    Should you be seeking confirmation that your intended recipient has taken delivery already or to get an updated delivery time, please be aware that we don’t have the ability to track your order and so therefore are unable to provide you with a delivery confirmation or expected time of delivery. In our experience, recipients generally contact you shortly after delivery to thank you for their gift either by phone, email or SMS. Bereavement orders can be a little different. We find that flowers sent to funerals or soon after a funeral service can take a couple of days to be acknowledged simply because of the sheer number of flowers received at the one time.
</p>
<p class="new-para-terms">
    Should you have reason to be concerned that your order hasn’t been delivered on the nominated day please firstly check your order confirmation to ensure the correct address was provided and then please confirm with your intended recipient that they aren’t in receipt of their gift. Be sure to have them check that it hasn’t been left at a front or back door that may not get used. Whilst we understand that this can be an uncomfortable call to make, we often find that there are reasons why the recipient hasn’t phoned you immediately upon receipt. Should the address be correct and you’ve spoken to the recipient who has confirmed they are not in receipt of your gift, please contact our Customer Service Team on the number provided above and they will be more than happy to investigate the matter further.

</p>

<h3 class="terms-heading">Recipient 'Not At Home'</h3>
<p class="new-para-terms">
    Petals Network and Network Members are not responsible for deliveries if the recipient is not at the location at the time of delivery or if incorrect or incomplete information is provided. If you are the customer, you must make sure that the recipient will be at the location on the date given on the order form for delivery or provide alternate instructions.
</p>
<p class="new-para-terms">
    It is recommended that a contact phone number for the recipient be provided on the order form so that should the courier have difficulty locating the address or is having difficulties accessing a building, the courier can contact the recipient to check if they are at the location before they attempt to deliver the gift. If you do not wish the recipient to be contacted you need to provide alternative contact details. If a phone number has not been provided on the order form and the recipient is either not at the location when the delivery is made or the courier has difficulty locating the delivery address completely they may do one of the following:
    <ul>
      <li>Leave a "not at home" card at the recipient's location and return the order to the florist. This card explains the situation and asks the recipient to contact the supplier to arrange delivery. Additional delivery charges may apply if the supplying florist has to deliver the gift more than once. Alternatively, the recipient may arrange to collect the order from the florist.
        </li>
        <li>If the courier deems the location to be a "safe" location the item will be left at the address provided. In these cases, delivery will be deemed to have been made successfully. If you do not want the order left at the address please ensure this information has been provided in the special instructions field on the order form.
          </li>
    </ul>
</p>

<h3 class="terms-heading">Fees & Charges</h3>
<p class="new-para-terms">
    Petals Network prices include a delivery and service fee in the total price shown at the checkout.
</p>

<h3 class="terms-heading">Non-Deliveries</h3>
<p class="new-para-terms">
    Petals Network and Network Members will try their best to deliver any gift, but we do not guarantee the delivery of any product if one of the following occurs:
    <ul>
      <li>Recipient refuses to accept delivery of the gift.</li>
      <li>Address provided is incorrect.</li>
      <li>Occupants are not at the location and do not respond to the "not at home" card left by our courier.</li>
    </ul>
</p>
<p class="new-para-terms">
    If one of these instances occurs, we may judge that the delivery has been made.
</p>

<h3 class="terms-heading">Cancellations</h3>
<p class="new-para-terms">
    Petals Network cannot cancel any order that has already been made up by the supplier, even if the order has not been delivered.
</p>

<h3 class="terms-heading">Refunds</h3>
<p class="new-para-terms">
    It is not normally policy to refund the price of the product. However, as every customer and gift is individual, (and therefore may require a decision on a case-by-case basis), please contact us so we can determine the best solution to the problem.
</p>
<p class="new-para-terms">
    Petals Network is also able to provide other solutions, such as resending the gift, or resending a different gift of the same value.
</p>

<h3 class="terms-heading">Time Sensitive/ Difficult/ Hospital Deliveries</h3>
<p class="new-para-terms">
    Due to the difficult nature of delivering for the following events/places, Petals Network and its suppliers cannot guarantee delivery to certain locations and times.
</p>
<p class="new-para-terms">
    While we will try our best to make sure that your gift is received at the event/place, we do advise you to include a secondary address for delivery. The recipient of the gift must be available at this address after the end of the event.
</p>
<p class="new-para-terms">
    Delivery to difficult and remote areas may incur extra delivery, above that already allowed in the gift value. The payment of extra delivery is the responsibility of the customer and orders cannot be delivered without such payment.
</p>
<p class="new-para-terms">
    <b>Please note:</b> That if the alternate delivery address is in a different area, and therefore requiring the services of a different supplier, Petals Network may not be able to assist with the redirection without wastage and delivery charges being paid to the initial supplier.
</p>
<p class="new-para-terms">
    Due to the perishable nature of our products, we do not deliver flowers and gifts to PO Boxes or Locked Bag addresses.
</p>
<p class="new-para-terms">
    We do not guarantee delivery to the following timed events:
    <ul>
      <li>Funerals.</li>
      <li>Wedding Receptions.</li>
      <li>Parties</li>
      <li>Functions</li>
    </ul>
</p>
<p class="new-para-terms">
    We do not guarantee delivery to the following places:
    <ul>
      <li>Hospitals (especially Intensive Care Units).</li>
      <li>Army, Airforce and Naval Bases</li>
      <li>Ships</li>
      <li>Jails</li>
      <li>Secure Buildings</li>
      <li>Hotels</li>
      <li>Mines</li>
    </ul>
</p>

<h3 class="terms-heading">Timed Deliveries</h3>
<p class="new-para-terms">
    Petals Network cannot guarantee specific delivery times for any orders other than for funerals. Whilst we offer customers the opportunity to nominate a preferred time of delivery for all other occasions it’s not possible to guarantee that these times will be achieved.
</p>
<p class="new-para-terms">
    Petals uses a network of local florists around the world to deliver flowers so that your recipient receives the freshest possible gift. Consequently, there are often local reasons why an order cannot be delivered within your preferred time frame.
</p>
<p class="new-para-terms">
    Our standard delivery times are:
    <ul>
      <li>Deliveries to residential and hospital addresses are usually completed between 9am and 7pm.</li>
      <li>For all other orders (not including Funerals) we deliver between 9am and 5pm.</li>
      <li>During peak periods such as Mother’s Day, Valentine’s Day and Christmas these delivery times may be extended.</li>
    </ul>
</p>
<p class="new-para-terms">
    We suggest that should you need to nominate a time you restrict your requests simply to AM or PM delivery. Should you choose to be more specific with the time it would be advantageous to clearly note the school or business address and if it’s for a timed event.  If the recipient is no longer going to be on the premises beyond the nominated time, please provide an alternate address so that should the need arise we can quickly redirect the order.
</p>
<p class="new-para-terms">
    <b>Note:</b> If delivery has been attempted and the recipient is no longer at the address and an alternate address was not provided please be aware that you may incur additional delivery fees to re-route the order and if you opt to cancel there may also be a wastage fee levied at 30% of the order value. Should the alternate delivery address fall outside of the nominated florists catchment it may also be necessary to allocate the order to another supplier.
</p>

<h3 class="terms-heading">Alcohol</h3>
<p class="new-para-terms">
    In Australia, it is illegal for alcohol to be purchased by or delivered to any person under the age of 18 and similar conditions may apply in other countries. The sender of the item is responsible for ensuring that their order complies with the law in this regard and absolves Petals and its subsidiaries of any responsibility in this regard.
</p>
<p class="new-para-terms">
    Petals Network does not guarantee the delivery of alcohol with all purchases. The laws regarding the sending of alcohol are very complicated.
</p>
<p class="new-para-terms">
    <b>Why Petals Network does not guarantee the delivery of alcohol with all purchases:</b>
    <ol>
      <li>Petals Network is unable to guarantee the recipient of the gift is over the legal age in that state or country.</li>
      <li>The recipient of the gift may have certain religious beliefs.</li>
      <li>Certain countries or States have laws that prohibit the sending of alcohol.</li>

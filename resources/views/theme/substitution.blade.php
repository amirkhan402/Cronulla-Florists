Sometimes it will be necessary for us to substitute flowers, wrapping or containers due to temporary, seasonal or regional availability issues. If this is the case with the gift you've selected, our experienced florists will ensure that the style, theme and colour scheme of your chosen item is preserved and will only substitute items of equal or higher value. We have strict substitution guidelines in place to ensure the integrity of the item you have chosen is maintained.
</p>
<p class="new-para-terms">
Where significant substitutions need to be made one of our friendly team will be in contact with you to discuss how to proceed. In the event that we canâ€™t reach you by phone, we may at times approve minor substitutions on your behalf in order to avoid disappointment or missing an important event.
